                  Tomorrow, you will be
                  released. If you are bored of brawling with
                  thieves and want to achieve something there
                  is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern
                  slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can
                  carry it to the top of the mountain, you may
                  find what you were looking for in the first place.
                  Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.
                  If you wanna kill a public servant,
                  Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.

                  You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse...
                   for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever
                   you stitch yourself up, you do make a
                   bloody mess. Ooh, you think darkness is your ally?
                   You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it.
                   Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was
                   already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.
